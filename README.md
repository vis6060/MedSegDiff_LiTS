# Social Impact Vision
Create a product for the Providers, i.e., hospitals, medical professionals and consumers utilizing generative AI technology to enable cancer prognosis and diagnosis and help reduce the cost of care delivery and out of pocket cost for the **masses especially in developing and under-developed countries as there is an opportunity to impact SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE in these countries.**

# Motivation
There are numerous papers in last three years on using generative AI techniques in medical imaging. In 
fact, multiple papers claim to have State of the Art performance proven over one or few datasets.   However, there is limited open dialogue on commercialization of these state-of-the-art models.


Based on the literature search of papers with open-source code, it was difficult to find any paper whose code can be used as-is to solve these use cases, in some cases it was challenging to find open-source datasets that fit the needs of the code and in some cases the open-source datasets only had less than 100 patient data points, which is generally insufficient to train/test these models.

The majority of use cases are cancer focused as this has the most open-source datasets.  Also, the statistics that 1 in 3 people will have cancer, thus, prevalence is going to be high in the future with the aging population. Also, President Biden two years ago started Cancer Moonshot project (to prevent 4 Million cancer deaths by 2047), thus, there will be lot of federal funding in this area.

Below, I have outlined some of my thoughts on possible use cases.
